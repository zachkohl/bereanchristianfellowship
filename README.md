Welcome. This is the repository for the Berean Christian Fellowship of Sagle Idaho. 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.


## contributing
To make changes, just push a pull request. I'll see about integrating your updates.

## Roadmap
we want to stay on react/nextjs. The goal is to use netlify cms and material ui as well. Other than that it is whatever.
